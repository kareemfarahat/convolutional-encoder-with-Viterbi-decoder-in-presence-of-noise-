# convolutional-encoder-with-Viterbi-decoder-in-presence-of-noise-
1. Design a rate 1 3 ‚ÅÑ convolutional encoder with constraint length K = 3. You are  free to choose the generator polynomials the way you wish. 2. Develop software code that implements the convolutional encoder without using built in functions in MATLAB 3. Add AWGN noise to the transmitted data 4. Implement the hard decision Viterbi decoder using your own developed MATLAB code. 5. Plot the BER versus SNR curve when using the convolutional code, versus without coding. 6. You are required to integrate Phase 2 of the project with Phase 1 (source coding) and have an end-to-end running communication system. 7. The received text file after adding noise and error correction should be compared with the transmitted text file indicating the errors that occurred in the received text for 3 different SNR values, with and without channel coding.
